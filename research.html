        <h3>Polar Research</h3>
        <p>I study the greenhouse effects of clouds and trace gases in the Arctic and Antarctic to understand
            their contributions to the energy budget. </p>
        <p>My graduate work involved infrared spectroscopy of water vapor, especially absorption between strong lines,
            or the water vapor continuum. This work was done as part of the South Pole Atmospheric Radiation and Cloud
            Lidar Experiment (SPARCLE) in 2000-2001 with Profs. Steve Warren and Von Walden.</p>
        <p>This work also included retrievals of temperature and water vapor from downwelling infrared radiance spectra,
            which is an ongoing interest.</p>
        <p>Recent work involves improving radiative transfer calculations of supercooled liquid cloud absorption and
            emission of infrared radiation. This improvement relies on incorporating the temperature dependence of
            the<span style="color: #00ffff;"> <a style="color: #00ffff;"

                    refractive indices of supercooled water</a>.</span></p>
        <p>My work also includes retrieving cloud properties from infrared radiation. I have investigated algorithms
            (such as optimal estimation) for retrieving cloud properties, including instrumental considerations such as
            calibration and instrument responsivity, sources of error such as biases, noise and error in knowledge of
            the atmospheric state, and limited spectral resolution. Microphysical cloud properties include optical
            depth, thermodynamic phase, and effective radius. I’m also interested in improving algorithms for cloud
            base-height retrieval.</p>
        <p>My work also seeks to improve our understanding of the atmosphere over the Antarctic Peninsula and Southern
            Ocean, using measurements made at Escudero Station, as part of the <a href="http://antarctica.cl/">
                Antarctic Research Group&nbsp; </a>of the University of Santiago of Chile. Working with colleagues,
            we are trying to understand
            interconnections between clouds and radiation and atmospheric rivers and foehn events.</p>

        <h3>PENGUIN</h3>
        Polar ENgagement through GUided INquiry (PENGUIN) is an NSF-funded project to develop modules that teach polar
        research through undergraduate students in a variety of courses.

        <h3>Black carbon</h3>
        <p>Black carbon is an anthropogenic pollutant that decreases the albedo of ice and snow. In the Chilean
            Andes, black carbon on glaciers enhances the melt rate. Because glaciers are an important source of drinking
            water in Chile, glacier loss is a topic of major concern. I participated in field expeditions (led by Steven
            Neshyba, in collaboration with Steve Warren of the University of Washington and Raul Cordero of the
            University of Santiago of Chile) to sample black carbon on snow in the Chilean Andes in July 2015 and 2016.
            Our group at the University of Santiago of Chile continues to measure black carbon in the Chilean Andes, as
            well as in Antarctica.</p>
        <p>During the summer of 2020, we expanded our black carbon measurements to include locations in
            Colorado and on Mt. Rainier, in Washington, as part of&nbsp; a virtual summer Research Experience for
            Undergraduates (REU) program. Two students sampled snow, while two additional students measured the impurity
            concentrations using the Light Absorbing Measurement (LAM)&nbsp; developed by Prof. Carl Schmitt.</p>

        <h3>Roughening on ice crystal surfaces</h3>
        <p>Advances in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) have made it possible to monitor the growth and
            ablation
            of ice crystals on the surfaces of ice crystals at resolutions not previously possible. In collaboration
            with
            Steven Neshyba, our work has revealed horizontal corrugations, or “trans-prismatic strands”, visible on <a
                href="http://webspace.pugetsound.edu/facultypages/nesh/">SEM images of ice</a> taken at the University
            of
            Puget Sound in collaboration with Steven Neshyba. We also examine consequences of the roughening for
            light-scattering properties affecting radiative flux and remote sensing.</p>

        <h3>Molecular dynamics at the ice-vapor interface</h3>
        <p>Other research includes studying surface roughness on ice crystals through SEM images and molecular
            dynamics, and using molecular dynamics to explore a possible role for RNA on ice in the origins of life on
            Earth.</p>
