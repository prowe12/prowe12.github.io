		<p>I am a data scientist and software engineer.
		For over a decade both roles have been essential to my research trying to understand a small piece of the climate change puzzle, through  collecting and analyzing geoscience data to study the greenhouse effect of clouds and trace gases in polar regions.

		<p>It's clear that humans are causing dangerous climate change. The consequences are dire - heat waves, fires, droughts, severe storms, and sea level rise. The changes we are making now will effect our climate for hundreds or even thousands of years. The same long timescales apply to the positive outcomes we can make by working to reduce our emissions.</p>
		<p>I'm driven to work toward solutions that mitigate our climate impact.</p>
