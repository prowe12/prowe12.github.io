    <h3>Clouds and Radiation over the Southern Ocean</h3>
    <p>Through interactions with infrared and shortwave radiation, clouds have competing cooling and warming effects. The overall effect depends on location, date, time, and cloud properties. Working with colleagues at the Chilean
        <a href="http://antarctica.cl/"> Antarctic Research Group</a>, we have been measuring radiation and clouds at Escudero Station, 
        situated on King George Island in the Southern Ocean, just north of the Antarctic Peninsula, since 2017. The goal of this research 
        is to improve our understanding of cloud and radiation processes, particularly during atmospheric rivers and
        foehn events. This work is part of the Year of Polar Prediction (YOPP) for the Southern Hemisphere.

            <h3>Pyranometer</h3>Pyrgeometers and pyranometers are used to measure downwelling longwave radiation
            (infrared) and shortwave radiation (sunlight). The pyranometer shown here measures shortwave radiation every minute year-round at
            Escudero Station, just north of the Antarctic Peninsula.

        <h3>Annual cycle of radiation</h3><p>To see the how radiation over the annual cycle, it's useful to average over each month. 
        Here we see that the monthly average longwave radiation is fairly constant over the year at Escudero Station, while the shortwave radiation
        varies strongly with season, falling to almost zero in the Austral winter. This figure shows the average over each month, 
        over the years 2017-2023, from the

    <h3>Cloud Property Retrievals</h3>
    <p> Algorithms such as optimal estimation for retrieving cloud properties are sensitive to instrumental
        considerations such as calibration and instrument responsivity, sources of error such as biases,
        noise and error in knowledge of the atmospheric state, and limited spectral resolution. Cloud property
        retrievals include optical depth, thermodynamic phase, effective radius and cloud base-height retrieval.

        <h3>Black carbon</h3>
        <p>Black carbon is an anthropogenic pollutant that decreases the albedo of ice and snow. In the Chilean
            Andes, black carbon on glaciers enhances the melt rate. Because glaciers are an important source of
            drinking
            water in Chile, glacier loss is a topic of major concern. I participated in field expeditions (led by
            Steven
            Neshyba, in collaboration with Steve Warren of the University of Washington and Raul Cordero of the
            University of Santiago of Chile) to sample black carbon on snow in the Chilean Andes in July 2015 and
            2016.
            Our group at the University of Santiago of Chile continues to measure black carbon in the Chilean Andes,
            as well as in Antarctica.</p>
        <p>During the summer of 2020, we expanded our black carbon measurements to include locations in
            Colorado and on Mt. Rainier, in Washington, as part of&nbsp; a virtual summer Research Experience for
            Undergraduates (REU) program. Two students sampled snow, while two additional students measured the
            impurity concentrations using the Light Absorbing Measurement (LAM), developed by Prof. Carl Schmitt.</p>
