Modeling the spread of COVID-19

Modeling COVID-19 v. 1 : Learn what a SIRD model is as you model the spread of COVID-19 in Jupyter Notebook.

Modeling COVID-19 v. 2 : Compare your SIRD model to real data (in development).
PENGUIN: Polar ENgagement through GUided INquiry

In order to bring polar research and data into undergraduate curricula, we have developed Computational Guided Inquiry
(CGI) modules that provide a framework for students to conduct inquiry through a Jupyter Notebook or an Excel sheet.

For educators: the materials needed to teach the modules are available at our PENGUIN site at the Science Education
Resource Center (SERC) of Carleton College. You can also check out the PENGUIN modules at gitHub or try them out on
Kaggle:

Processing Images of Arctic Ice
Satellites capture images of the globe continuously, providing a changing view of Earth’s surface. These images reveal
land cover and allow tracking events like hurricanes and fires. This module explores image processing of satellite
images in polar regions. The module starts with exploring how images are loaded, plotted, and stored; how they can be
manipulated to produce true and false-color and black and white images; and color mapping. Activites also include edge
detection, noise removal, determining snow and sea ice extent, and scene identification.

Ice Cores and Climate Change
As snow accumulates onto ice sheets over hundreds or thousands of years, air bubbles are trapped as the snow is
compressed into firn and then ice. Ice cores serve as recorders of past climate and atmospheric concentration. In this
module, work with data from ice cores from the East Antarctic Ice Sheet and Greenland, in order to explore earth’s past
climate and glacial cycles. Explore how temperature and CO2 vary over the last 425,000 years, and how this is linked to
changes in Earth’s orbit.

Permafrost
Learn what permafrost is, the implications of permafrost thawing due to climate change, and how to calculate heat
diffusion through permafrost. Activities include watching a video about permafrost, checking out a journal article, and
downloading, plotting and analyzing permafrost data. Learn how permafrost temperature changes with depth underground,
seasonally, and annually, and calculate heat flow through permafrost.

Polar Spectra
Learn about the greenhouse effect by examining a “forbidden” rovibrational band in the infrared emission spectra of
Earth’s atmosphere, recorded from the surface at South Pole Station. By weighting rotational energy degeneracies with a
Boltzmann factor, you can simulate the R-branch of the band – the result is a rudimentary estimate of the average
temperature of the troposphere above the South Pole. Finally, try a second method of estimating the near-surface
temperature, through matching South Polar radiative emission to a Planck Blackbody Spectrum.

Seasonal Arctic Ice Melt
Learn about thermodynamics topics through calculation of the amount of heat required to melt Arctic sea ice. Watch an
online animation of changing polar ice with time, downloading data of Arctic ice extent and volume. Activities include
using thermodynamic principles and equations to plot the phase diagram of water, find the freezing point depression of
Arctic sea ice in equilibrium with sea water, and compute the change in the enthalpy of fusion of water resulting from
that temperature depression.
